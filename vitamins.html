							<p><strong>Vitamins</strong> are chemical molecules that are required in little amounts by humans.

								<strong>Vitamin A</strong> specifically is necessary for maintaining healthy eyes, good vision, healthy skin, and helps you fight off infection. Over time, this can lead to numerous health concerns including vision problems, decreased immunity, and death. Severe deficiency is much more common in countries experiencing challenging socioeconomic conditions as well as limited to no access to vitamin A-rich foods.
								<br /><br />
								<h5><strong>Causes:</strong></h5>Vitamin A deficiency may be caused by prolonged inadequate intake of vitamin A. This is especially so when rice is the main food in your diet (rice doesn't contain any carotene). <br /> Vitamin A deficiency may also occur when your body is unable to make use of the vitamin A in your diet. This may occur in a variety of illnesses, including:
								<ul>
									<li>Coeliac disease</li>
									<li>Crohn's disease</li>
									<li>Giardiasis - an infection of the gut (bowel)</li>
									<li>Cystic fibrosis</li>
									<li>Diseases affecting the pancreas</li>
									<li>Liver cirrhosis</li>
									<li>Obstruction of flow of bile from your liver and gallbladder into your gut</li>
								</ul>
								<br />
								<h5><strong>Home remedies:</strong></h5>
								<ul>
									<li>The treatment for mild forms of vitamin A deficiency includes eating vitamin A-rich foods - liver, beef, oily fish, chicken, eggs, fortified milk, carrots, mangoes, sweet potatoes, and leafy green vegetables.</li>
									<li>For more severe forms of vitamin A deficiency causing symptoms, treatment includes taking daily oral vitamin A supplements.</li>
									<li>Food:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Liver: This type of food contains large amounts of vitamin A. One helping of liver contains more than the recommended minimum intake of vitamin A for a week.</li>
										<li>Fish: Oily fish, shellfish, and cod liver oil all contain quite a bit of vitamin A and can be eaten with meals or consumed as vitamin supplements.</li>
										<li>Vegetables: Orange vegetables have the highest level of vitamin A. The most common ones include sweet potato, pumpkin, carrot, and squash. Other green leafy vegetables like spinach, greens, and lettuce are also great options. Experts recommend cooking or processing these veggies to get the full benefit of vitamin A so that it's easier for the body to digest and absorb its nutritional value.</li>
										<li>Dairy products: Milk is generally a good source of vitamin A, although the amount in skim milk is lower than in full cream milk. Many soft cheeses may contain vitamin A as well, although cheddar cheese contains more than others.</li>
										<li>Fruits: Common fruits with the highest level of vitamin A are often orange — ripe mango, papaya, cantaloupe melon, and apricots — which can be consumed dried or fresh.</li>

							Vitamin B12

							<p>
								<strong>Vitamin B12</strong> deficiency may lead to a reduction in healthy red blood cells (anemia). The nervous system also may be affected. Diet or certain medical conditions may be the cause.
								<br /><br />
								<h5><strong>Causes:</strong></h5>Several things can cause vitamin B12 deficiency, these include: 
								<ul>
									<li>Pernicious Anemia - your immune system mistakenly attacks cells in your stomach that produce intrinsic factor (which you need to absorb vitamin B12).</li>
									<li>Diet - plant-based diets, such as vegan, vegetarian, and dairy-free diets are sometimes lacking in vitamin B12.</li>
									<li>Medication - some medications, like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can inhibit absorption of vitamin B12.</li>
									<li>Are pregnant or breastfeeding.</li>
									<li>Are over 50 years - because you might stop producing enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach which is needed for absorption of vitamin B12.</li>
									<li>Suffer from a gastrointestinal disorder - like coeliac disease or Crohn’s disease.</li>
									
								</ul>
								<br />
								<h5><strong>Home remedies:</strong></h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Diet (Foods rich in B12 include):</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Organ meats - like liver and kidney are the richest sources of vitamin B12</li>
										<li>Beef</li>
										<li>Fish - like clams, sardines, salmon, and tuna</li>
										<li>Milk and dairy products</li>
										<li>Eggs</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Vitamin B12 is only naturally available in meat, fish or dairy. But there are fortified plant-based sources of vitamin B12 like:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Fortified milk alternatives</li>
										<li>Fortified cereals</li>
										<li>Fortified nutritional yeast</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Suppliments</li>
									<ul>
										<li>You can also take a vitamin B12 supplement. It’s usually available as cyanocobalamin - a form which your body can easily convert and use. It's also possible to get a vitamin B12 injection - this is especially useful if your deficiency is caused by absorption issues in your stomach. The form hydroxocobalamin can be given every three months.</li>

								<strong>Vitamin C</strong> is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Humans, unlike most animals, are unable to synthesize vitamin C endogenously, so it is an essential dietary component.
								<br /><br />
								<h5><strong>Causes:</strong></h5>
								<ul>
									<li>No natural vitamin food sources:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Your diet contains little to no natural vitamin food sources, such as meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Overcooking:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Consistently overcooking your food also can cause vitamin deficiency.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Pregnancy:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>When you're pregnant, and you aren't taking a multivitamin. Folic acid supplements are especially important during pregnancy.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Other medical conditions:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>You have intestinal problems or other medical conditions that interfere with absorption of vitamins.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Alcohol:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>You abuse alcohol. Alcohol interferes with the absorption of folate and vitamin C, as well as other vitamins.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Other prescriptions:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>You take certain prescription medications that can block absorption of vitamins. Anti-seizure drugs can block the absorption of folate.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<br />
								<h5><strong>Home remedies:</strong></h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Men are advised to have 90mg of Vitamin C and women are advised to have 75mg of Vitamin C.</li>
									<li>Some of the best foods for Vitamin C are: Guava, Kiwi, Lemon, Lychee, Strawberry, Papaya, and Broccoli.</li>
									<li>It is recommended to eat fresh fruits and vegetables daily.</li>
									<li>Vitamin C supplements.</li>

								<strong>Vitamin D</strong> is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in a few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strikes the skin and triggers vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, foods, and supplements is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation.
								<br /><br />
								<h5><strong>Causes:</strong></h5>
								<ul>
									<li>You don't consume the recommended levels of the vitamin over time:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>This is likely if you follow a strict vegan diet, because most of the natural sources are animal-based, including fish and fish oils, egg yolks, fortified milk, and beef liver.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Your exposure to sunlight is limited:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Because the body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight, you may be at risk of deficiency if you are homebound, live in northern latitudes, wear long robes or head coverings for religious reasons, or have an occupation that prevents sun exposure.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>You have dark skin:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>The pigment melanin reduces the skin's ability to make vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Your kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>As people age, their kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form, thus increasing their risk of vitamin D deficiency.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Your digestive tract cannot adequately absorb vitamin D:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Certain medical problems, including Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease, can affect your intestine's ability to absorb vitamin D from the food you eat.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>You are obese:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Vitamin D is extracted from the blood by fat cells, altering its release into the circulation.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<br />
								<h5><strong>Home remedies:</strong></h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Spend time in sunlight since the sun is the best source of this vitamin.</li>
									<li>Consume fish and seafood since it is rich in Vitamin D.</li>
									<li>Consume more mushrooms since they can make their own Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight.</li>
									<li>Vitamin D supplements.</li>

								<strong>Vitamin E</strong> is an essential component for eyesight, reproduction, and blood, brain, and skin health. It functions as an antioxidant in the body, helping to protect cells from free radical damage. Vitamin E is also required for the body's immune system to fight off invading germs and viruses. It aids in the widening of blood vessels and the prevention of blood clotting inside them.
								<br /><br />
								<h5><strong>Causes:</strong></h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Genetics:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Vitamin E deficiency often runs in families. Learning about family history can make diagnosing certain rare, inherited diseases easier. Two of these diseases, congenital abetalipoproteinemia and familial isolated vitamin E deficiency, are chronic and result in extremely low vitamin E levels.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Medical conditions:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Vitamin E deficiency can also result from diseases that severely reduce the absorption of fat. This is because the body requires fat to absorb vitamin E correctly.</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Some of these deiseases include:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Chronic pancreatitis</li>
												<li>Celiac disease</li>
												<li>Cholestatic liver disease</li>
												<li>Cystic fibrosis</li>
